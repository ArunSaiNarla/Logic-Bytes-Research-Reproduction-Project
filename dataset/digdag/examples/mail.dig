    # To use Gmail SMTP server, you need to do either of:
    #   a) Generate a new app password at
    #      https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords
    #      This needs to enable 2-Step Verification first.
    #   b) Enable access for less secure apps at
    #      https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps
    #      This works even if 2-Step Verification is not enabled.
    # And then, execute to set password:
    #      digdag secret --local --set mail.password=...password...
