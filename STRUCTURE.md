This package contains the code and data used to produce the results described in the paper titled ***Generating REST API Specifications through Static Analysis***, in Proceedings of the 46th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), 2024. Its structure is as follows.

- The folder "source" contains the source code of Respector and the README to compile and run Respector on the APIs.
- The folder "dataset" contains the source code of 15 APIs we evaluated Respector on and a README to compile each of the 15 APIs.
- The folder "results" contains three subfolders (RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3) describing the precomputed results presented in the paper corresponding to the three research questions.
